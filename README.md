# Robot-Kinematics-Dynamics-MEGN544

This repo contains code from a robot kinematics and dynamics course. The bulk of the code was written for a class project to model and simulate the dynamics of a 6-link ABB robot arm manipulator to spell out CSM (The initials of Colorado School of Mines) on a whiteboard. This was done in MATLAB and Simulink.
